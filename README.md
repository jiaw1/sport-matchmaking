Add required environment variables through creating a secret called `sport-matchmaking-frontend-secrets`, for example using the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic sport-matchmaking-frontend-secrets
  --from-literal=key1=value1 \
  --from-literal=key2=value2
```

### Add match service URL

Edit `./app/lib/definitions.ts`, line 10:

```TypeScript
export const matchServiceURL = "https://match-service.sport-matchmaking.thong.cam" // Replace with your match service URL. 
```

### Build Docker image

```Bash
docker build -t sport-matchmaking-frontend .
```

Optionally push the image to your Container Image Repository of choice.

### Run on Kubernetes

Edit `./kubernetes/ingress.yaml` to set correct ingress for your service.

Run the service with 

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes/
```
